# Board-Game-Manager

This is just a project i made for school to demonstate a few basic programming fundamentals. It allows you to create a collection of games that you're able to sort through using various methods to do things like narrow down options for a game night with variable amounts of people or time to play. It stores the list of games offline in XML format.
